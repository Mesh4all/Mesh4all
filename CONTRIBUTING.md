<h2 id="titlegs"> Getting Started </h2>

---

if you are starting to work with mesh4all, you can read our documentation, and you will know all supported boards, and resources.

First Steps:
1. Cloning
2. Update submodules.

<br>
To start with m4ag-firmware, we need to clone the repository:

<br>

### 1. Cloning

#### Via SSH:
```sh
    git clone git@github.com:Mesh4all/Mesh4all.git
```
#### Via HTTPS:
```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mesh4all/Mesh4all.git
```

*Note:* We recommend cloning through SSH, due to external dependencies of some module

# Mesh4all

Mesh4all Inc is dedicated to maintaining opensource software and hardware directories with appropriate documentation in multiple languages. To guarantee access to resilient, persistent mesh networks worldwide. We will also be tasked to disseminate the technology among faculty, students and businesses in developing nations where accessibility to the internet is limited and non-existent.  May the mesh be with you. 


The mesh we are working on will be known as Mesh4: join, use, speak, send, pay, mesh4all!
